<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer does exactly what it sounds like it does - visualizes algorithms. This desktop application utilizes an unweighted and undirected grid as the graph that the algorithms will traverse. Click anywhere to place the start node, and click a second time to place the end node. After the start and end nodes have been placed, clicking will create a "wall" node (a node that is not traversable by the algorithms). Chose from the dropdown to select an algorithm, press start, and watch the magic happen. As the algorithm traverses the grid, open nodes are green, closed nodes are blue, and the shortest path nodes are purple. Clicking the "Show Heuristic" button will add the algorithm's heuristic to the visualization. If the algorithm has no heuristic - like BFS - it will not be shown. Finally, the application includes an 'Analytics' tab. After each run, this menu will be updated with the type of algorithm, nodes searched, and Nodes seen from the previous run.
