Users can select from 3 different algorithms to visualize on the 2d grid including A*, and Breadth-First Search, and Best-First Search.
The user can change the location of the start and end node. 
The user can turn any node into a ‘wall node’ that is unsearchable by the algorithm by clicking on an empty node.
The user can access a log of previous runs that includes the name of the algorithm, node length of the shortest path, and the number of total nodes searched.  
The visualization will also show the algorithm’s heuristic. The user can toggle this feature on and off. 
The user can change the speed of the algorithm with a slider 
The user can select an option that allows them to step through each operation every time they press a button.
